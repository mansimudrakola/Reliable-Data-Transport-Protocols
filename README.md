# Reliable-Data-Transport-Protocols

## Overview

This project focuses on the implementation of three reliable data transport protocols: Alternating-Bit (ABT), Go-Back-N (GBN) and Selective-Repeat (SR) on a C++ Simulator. The goal is to provide a robust and efficient communication framework 
based on the specifications outlined in the textbook. The implementations cover a range of pages (ABT: 208-211, GBN: 215-220, SR: 220-226) and adhere to the PA2 template for consistency and compatibility.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow the detailed instructions provided in the **PA2** Instructions document. Ensure that you use this template as it is mandatory for the project.

## Programming Environment

The project is coded in C++ and is meant to compile under the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) environment. The code should be compiled and tested on the ONE host assigned by the course instructor. Do not use any machine other than the designated host.

### Compilation Process

Compile the code using the `g++` (for C++ code) version found on the assigned host. The compilation process should not involve any disk I/O unless explicitly stated in the project description.
